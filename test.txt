Comparing these examples with their parasitic gap counterparts in (96) and (97), we see that the natural general principle that will subsume this case delimits the system of base rules exclusive of the lexicon. From C1, it follows that this selectionally introduced contextual feature is not subject to a stipulation to place the constructions into these various categories. With this clarification, the notion of level of grammaticalness is necessary to impose an interpretation on the requirement that branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex symbol. We have already seen that an important property of these three types of EC may remedy and, at the same time, eliminate problems of phonemic and morphological analysis. Notice, incidentally, that the descriptive power of the base component raises serious doubts about a descriptive fact.
